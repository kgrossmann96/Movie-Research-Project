As I said in the README, I did this project as a somewhat silly endeavor
As such, there were some poor practices in my data collection
I used 400 movies with information I got from IMDB
This includes the top 100 and bottom 100
The other 200 were movies I chose and not representative of a random sample
I included budget and ROI as factors, and because ROI is derived by dividing by budget I set budgets to a small but non-zero number if they were unknown
One of the factors is star, representing number of famous actors in the movie, but this was subjective based on who I recognized
Finally, the factor book is meant to represent if the film was based on a book and I did not research every movie to verify if it was based on a book or not
I don't regret these errors as there was nothing at stake but I wanted to address them for professional sake
