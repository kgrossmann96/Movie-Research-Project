# Movie-Research-Project
An analysis of what makes a movie well-liked
I made this as part of a project my friends and I agreed to do senior year of college
We were each to spend the year researching in some way a somewhat silly topic
I chose How to Make the Best movie and this is the objective part of my approach
See the Errors file for my mistakes in data collection.
